Figure out how the program counter should be changed [DONE]
- the program counter is incremented by the amount of bytes an instruction takes
- if ld_n_nn = 3 bytes then we will pc += 3, etc..

Implement LD instructions [DONE] (are they fully correct?)


Mon 14th Apr:
- Implement INC and DEC instructions [DONE]
- Change switch cases to Java 12's switch expression (more concise) [DONE]
- Change register if else's to switch expressions [DONE]

So far LD's and INC/DEC are implemented. Next we'll do ADD instruction

Tue 15th Apr:
- Implement the 21 opcodes for ADD instruction [DONE]
- Refactor this code (reduce the flag checks to 1 method) [DONE]


Thu 17th Apr:
We still have a lot of repeated code. Especially where we essentially do the same thing but access
a different register. Reducing this to a for loop (from a to l) would reduce our code by prob 20-30%,
but then our accesses become iterative instead of instant...
